# BioSoundSCape: Overview
This is the BioSoundSCape project, a group continuation project, further developing the BioSoundSCape project started by Colin A. Quin et. al., to collect sound data from a large area to determine the biodiversity of particular regions within that area. The project focuses on the development of a CNN that detects regions of interest (ROIs) that can be classified into: Anthropophony, Biophony, Geophony, Quiet, or Interference. The work on the project thus far has been using this Sonoma County data and thus has been trained exclusively on this particular data. 

# New Problem
Due to the fact that the previous project was trained and designed for the Sonoma County data, new data collected in a different way has a difficult time being classified by this CNN. So, the new problem is the new data having arrived from South Africa, captured in an entirely different place and captured in different ways. 

# New Goal
My team's goal in this project is to use what the previous teams have learned from this project and use it on the new data. The CNN created for the old data now needs to be trained and fine-tuned in order to perform better on this new data as well. 

# The Project Results
Our efforts and results can be found in the zip folder within this directory. Using the README.txt file contained in the zipped folder, you should be able to utilize the code and data within to get the same results as our group was able to gather. To learn more about an overview of our results and goals for the project, you can also find a presentation file that we used to present our findings to other classmates.
