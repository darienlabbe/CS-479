# Natural15 Scene Classification
This project uses the Natural 15 dataset has some issues of overfitting and thus adds an extra challenge when developing CNNs for this particular dataset. For this project in particular, I developed four different CNNs, starting simple and working towards more and more complex designs. The first CNN was a simple one with only 11 total layers and a goal of demonstrating the overfitting problem. The second CNN that I made tries to use a number of different techniques to mitigate the overfitting problem, like kernal L2 regularizors with weight decay, dropout layers, and batch normalization. The second CNN did not focus on trying to improve the overall practical accuracy of the model, and instead was a way of testing how to decrease the overall amount of overfitting. The third CNN that I created used what I learned in the second CNN and I utilized transfer learning to include the ResNet50 model with a number of additional layers as well. This third CNN ended with an accuracy of about ~74%-76% validation accuracy when testing and I felt that I could do better so I made a fourth CNN. The fourth CNN was a culmination of what I had learned from the previous three CNNs as well as a new transfer model, the VGG19 model. In the end I was able to improve my overall model by quite a lot through a lot of fine-tuning and the inclusion of a number of other techniques to attempt to increase my overall accuracy.
