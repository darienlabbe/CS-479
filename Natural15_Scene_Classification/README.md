# Natural 15 Scene Dataset Classification

This is the project using the Natural 15 dataset to create several different types of CNNs to predict different types of scenes in the dataset. The code is contained in the Jupyter Notebook and the data is contained in the zip file labeled zip. If you wish to run the notebook yourself, I would recommend using Google Colab in order to not have to deal with installing an environment to run it. Also, keep the data folder as a zip and add it to the local files of the notebook so that it can unzip it for you.
