# CS-479
Repository containing the projects for the Sonoma State course CS 479 under the instruction of Dr. Gurman Gill. All code for the projects are contained in Jupyter Notebooks. If you wish to run them yourself, I recommend that you use Google Colab in order to avoid needing an environment to run them.
